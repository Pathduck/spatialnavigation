__Spatial Navigation Chrome Extension__

Smart spatial navigation with key map to links.

This is based off the *Spatial Navigation* extension by Falsandtru:\
https://github.com/falsandtru/spatial-navigation

Binds WASD, F, E and Q keys for navigation/hints.

* `W/A/S/D`: Four-way spatial navigation
* `E/Shift+E`: Expand/Contract (change link targets)
* `Q`: Quit navigation/hints mode
* `Enter/F`: Click link
* `Shift+Enter/Shift+F`: Shift-click link (open new focused tab)
* `Ctrl+Enter/Ctrl+F`: Ctrl-click link (open new background tab)
* `Ctrl+Shift+X`: Disable the hotkeys (for current tab)

Set your own keys: Click the icon and choose Options, or visit the details page in the browser extension manager.
